## About

This project implements a smart inventory and order management system with the following goals:
- Track inventory across locations
- Automate reorder suggestions and order creation
- Provide a responsive web UI for inventory and order management
- Demonstrate a production-ready architecture with CI/CD and deployment diagrams

---

## Features

- Product and inventory management
- Orders, suppliers, and purchase workflows
- Notifications for low stock
- Role-based access and simple auth (see backend)
- REST API backend and React (or similar) frontend (see repositories linked above)

---

## Tech stack

- Frontend: (see frontend repo) — likely React / TypeScript / CSS framework
- Backend: (see backend repo) — Node/Express or Python/Flask (see backend repo for exact stack)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (configured in backend repo)
- CI/CD: Automated pipelines for tests, builds, and deployment (diagram included above)

## Local setup

1. Clone the repositories:
   - Frontend: `git clone https://github.com/QuantumSoham/smart_order_inventory_mgmt_system_frontend.git`
   - Backend: `git clone https://github.com/QuantumSoham/smart_order_inventory_mgmt_system_backend.git`

2. Follow each repo's README for environment setup, installing dependencies, and running locally.

3. If you want to run both services together:
   - Start the backend service and ensure its API is reachable (default port documented in backend README).
   - Start the frontend and point its API base URL to your running backend.

---

## Development & CI/CD

- CI runs: tests, linting, build steps (see CI/CD pipeline in backend/frontend repos).
- Deployment: diagrams above show the intended deployment topology (cloud provider, containerization, load balancer, database, etc.)
- Add workflows or pipeline YAML into `.github/workflows/` in the frontend/backend repos as needed.
